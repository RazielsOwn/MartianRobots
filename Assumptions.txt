Assumptions:

1) Default direction for robot is North if none or bad data provided
2) Missing or wrong action for robot is ignored and skiped
3) As x and y is less or equal than 50 by initial problem statement we can be sure to override GetHash function for group of coordinates and direction (x,y,d)
4) As each robot is processed sequentially, there is no need for "bad coordinates" collection syncronization.
